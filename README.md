# Sanke_Game

A snake game is an arcade maze game which has been developed by Gremlin Industries and published by Sega in October 1976. It is considered to be a skilful game and has popularized among people for generations. The objective of this python project is to build a snake game. In this python project, the player has to move a snake so it touches the fruit. If the snake touches itself or the border of the game then the game will over.

# Objectives

<li>The snake in the Snake game is controlled using the four direction buttons relative to the direction it is headed in.</li>
<li>The player’s objective in the game is to achieve maximum points as possible by collecting food or fruits.</li>
<li>The player loses once the snake hits the wall or hits itself.</li>

# Problem definition

created a Python-based-game using the following modules: 

<li><em>Turtle:</em> It is a pre-installed python library that enables users to create shapes and pictures by providing them a virtual canvas. </li>
<li><em>Time:</em> This function is used to count the number of seconds elapsed since the epoch. </li>
<li><em>Random:</em> This function is used to generate random numbers in Python by using random module. </li>
<li><em>Pygame:</em> This function is used to generate graphics. </li>

<li>To move the snake, use 'up arrow' for up, 'down arrow' for down, 'left arrow for left and right arrow' for right.</li>
<li>Again, there are constants you can change if you want to alter these settings. Press 'ESC' to exit the game at any time.</li>
<li>The aim of the game is to collect the dots (food) and avoid the obstacles (crosses, borders, and the snake itself). As you collect food, the snake gets longer, so increasing your likelihood of crashing into yourself.
